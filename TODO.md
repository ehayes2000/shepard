Shepard is an agent manager for claude code.
Shepard aims to be an improvement to opening lots of terminals and spinning up worktrees for each session.


Core features
  - create new sessions
    1. create a worktree
    2. pull main 
    3. create a branch
    4. start a process (agent)
  - list seesions
  - switch between sessions
  
All of this should be done using ratatui and rust
This will manage claude code agents but the code should theoretically support managing any process
