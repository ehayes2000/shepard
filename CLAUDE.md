# Commits 
This is a small personal project and doesn't need extensive testing plans and garbage.
When you make a commit use a conventional semantic commit message (feat, chore, fix) with a
one line description of what you did. 

If a pr is more than a single commit then the body should contain the commit message of each commit
otherwise the body should be left blank
